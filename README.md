# MATH496_Capstone_Project
This repository includes all the files for my capstone project

Files:
1. Misuse of AI-RR-Student-Survey (Direct Questioning)_last: Dataset for the direct questioning survey
2. Misuse of AI-RR-Student-Survey (Crosswise Model)_last: Dataset for the crosswise model survey
3. Direct Questioning Survey Questions: Survey questions for the direct questioning survey
4. Crosswise Model Survey Questions: Survey questions for the crosswise model survey
5. recode.fun: Function that recodes the survey responses for analysis
6. dq_analysis1: Script file containing all of the analysis for direct questioning
7. cm_analysis1: Script file containing all of the analysis for the crosswise model

Please Note:
- Please download and save the datasets, recode function, and script files in the same location.
- To import the datasets into the script files, copy their file paths and paste them over the file path in the read_csv function.
- Only run the crosswise model dataset in the cm_analysis1 script file and the direct questioning dataset in the dq_analysis1 script file.
- Once the datasets have been imported, run the whole script files for the full analysis.
- In the crosswise model, if the logistic regression model for student group chats (gc_mod) returns an error, run it again.
